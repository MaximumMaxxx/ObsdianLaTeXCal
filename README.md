# ObsidianRam
### A relatively lightweight plugin to graph and evaluate equations.

## Why?
- Wolfram Alpha is cool
- Graphing math equations is useful for notes
- I wanted to make an obsidian plugin
- Checking your work is annoying

## How?
#### Manual install
- Clone this repository
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm build`
- Copy the plugin to your obsidian plugins directory

#### Store install
- Whever I get around to it

**You need an api key from wolframalpha to use this**

## How to use it?
- Two commands
  - Evalute the math
    - Runs the equation and returns the result (This will either be true or false or the solution(s))
  - Graph the math
    - Runs the equation and returns the graph (Wolfram doesn't always return a graph tho so will produce a warning if it fails)
